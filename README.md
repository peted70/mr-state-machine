# MR State Machine

Very simple state machine that can be used to move through different 'states' within a scene by disabling/enabling a gameobject hierarchy and associating a StateBase-derived script to handle state-related entry points such as StateEnter/StateExit. This will evolve over time to add functionality and/or may be replaced with a better solution. Extending to provide editor support, transitions and standard state components might be an option or making use of mechanim might be another approach.
